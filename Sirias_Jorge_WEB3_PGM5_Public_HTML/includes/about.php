           <div style="color:gold; font-size:20px;">We at Comix Shoppe are a direct to consumer online retail site. We sell comic books from 5 main publishers
            which includes DC, Image, Marvel, Valiant and Dark Horse. Although we primarily sell from these 5 publishers we can accomodate other 
            requests for our clients if they are looking for a particular comic from a different publisher than the ones aforementioned. For such a request
            please put your in your request in the text box area of our website labeled "requests".
            <br><br>When it comes to our comics that we sell they come in three different formats. We have the traditional single issues which can be
            delivered on a weekly or biweekly basis. We also have our most popular choice which are trade paperbacks which are volumes that covers a
            particular story arc which are 6 to 7 issues long. If you are the type to read a coherent story uninterrupted then this is the choice for you.
            For the purist and collectionist we sell omnibuses which are books as thick as encyclopedias that cover various story arcs that span years of
            storytelling.<br><br>We would like to give you our warm welcome and hoped you landed on our page intentionally. Please explore our site and 
            feel free to roam around at your hearts content. If you have any questions please contact us at our page. Happy reading!</div>
